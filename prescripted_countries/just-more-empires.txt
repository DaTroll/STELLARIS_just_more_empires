The native molluscoids of Naff'Lin, the Tymosh, live in neurosymbiosis with an eel-like creature. Their all-encompassing church promotes the belief that all sentient beings (and the economies that they generate) exist in a similar relationship with an otherworldly spirit known as the Invisible Tentacle. Contacting that spirit, which is most often attempted to win its favor in some material pursuit or another, is achieved through a series of complex rituals and investment decisions. The more financially advantageous those investments are to the Adherence, the greater the spiritual rapture... or so they say."

This gave several species of mammalians an evolutionary opportunity, and in time one of them came to dominate the planet and develop an industrial civilization. Their industry soon began to melt the ice, releasing ancient spores long ago trapped in the permafrost. Most were harmless, but one species of awoken fungi had a unique psychoactive effect on the population. The Amaranth first hijacked its victims' central nervous systems and drove them into a ravening zombie-like madness. Past a certain point of saturation, however, it began to unlock the nascent telepathic potential of its hosts, creating a networked consciousness of its own. Melding its own fundamental impulses with the baser instincts of its victims, the Efflorescence hungers greedily and insatiably for expansion. The total consumption of Grithor was completed swiftly, and the Amaranth may yet consume the entire galaxy."

Autocratic states and Enlightenment-era republics gave way to streamlined technocratic social democracies far less concerned with national fortunes than with the common good. The United Nations evolved from a diplomatic forum into a proper planetary government. The UN's plenary council manages most of humanity's interstellar affairs via the Earth Colonial Administration. More confident, far-seeing, capable, and prudent than at any other time in their history, the people of Earth finally look to the stars. With their planetary home at last in order, the frontier is everywhere and the open road still softly calls."

Post-war reforms established a federalized global government with both representative and privy councils under the leadership of the Emperor. To administer global affairs, ensure societal control, and drive economic prosperity, the crown established the Imperial Enterprise. The Enterprise is a massive nationalized corporation to which a sizeable percentage of the Raskenese population is indentured, many by their own choice. Terms of voluntary indenture last between five and fifty years, offer proportionate benefits upon completion, and typically involve less grueling and dangerous labor than 'punitive' or 'reformative' indenture. While outsiders often see only this monolithic face of the Federal Empire, a diversity of cultures and lifestyles continue to thrive in its local jurisdictions."

Chasing the dream of an 'eternal peace congress', this trend eventually resulted in the formation of a planetary Economic Union.

Thereafter, Rome withstood the rapine of tribal usurpers and weathered centuries of turmoil to remain a dominant political force in Europe. Technology swiftly progressed, leading to increased contact and trade between Terra's great powers. Brutal conflicts with the Chinese and Indian empires over spheres of influence cost many lives, but did little to forestall the Roman Emperors' dominance of their  homeworld. By the industrial age, however, the power of the mercantile elector class within Rome's upper echelons grew to outstrip that of the Senate and even the Emperor himself. These old imperial institutions still exist in the Interstellar Age, but as mere figureheads. Deeply embedded within Terran science, industry, and finance, the Church holds the true reins of power. While the Emperor remains head of state, the highest ecclesiastic leader in Terran society, the Supreme Pontif, is its de facto ruler. This civilization of fortune-building priests, built on the backs of a billion slaves and controlled by an impenetrable bureaucracy, now aims to own the stars themselves."

During periods of isolation, they build trinkets, compose poetry, practice jokes, and study the mystic arts of the memeways in the hopes of impressing a caller or visitor. If this fails, they may become frustrated and physically compel a guest to stay. Once trapped, their victims can expect a slow torture by endless rambling hyperbolic conversation and frantic attempts by the Phasgol to demonstrate their cultural savvy and social value.

They named it Miranda. There, the colonists quickly put into practice a brave new genetic engineering program to rapidly adapt to the alien planet. In the process, their society bifurcated. A small population of genetically superior lab-grown ('decanted') humans, calling themselves Mirandans, assumed leadership of the colony. Meanwhile, a rapidly reproducing population of genetically labotomized subhuman laborers, called Calibans, were tasked with the hard and dangerous frontier duties of colonial expansion. This experiment enabled the extremely rapid settlement of Miranda and a return to spaceflight within a century of their arrival, but its long-term societal costs can only be guessed at. Mirandans typically distinguish themselves from Calibans by wearing white, grey, or silver clothing."

A consequence of their genetic modifications, however, is accelerated telomeric degeneration, resulting in shorter average lifespans."

Foresaking the mundanity of their former Earthly lifestyles, these Human colonists let the mists of New Eden permeate their souls. Then Azrael gave them their greatest revelation: they too were angels, the agents of God, and they bore a divine duty. Now striking out from their elysian stronghold, the Order of Azrael's Chosen obeys its Prime Commandment: discover the lynchpins of interstellar power, subvert their political and economic power to serve Heaven, and free this galaxy from sin."

Learning to extend their awareness outward, beyond the self of body, to embrace the self of group and the self of Humanity, followers found sollace amid endless turmoil.

Invigorated by a new era of frontiersmanship, these societies birthed a Renaissance spanning from Qurtuba to Makka to Jayakarta. During Earth's Industrial and Machine Ages, the Dar al-Islam came into frequent conflict with the Indian Travancore League and Chinese Empire. The struggle between these three blocs culminated in the Long War, spanning decades and killing hundreds of millions. Such horrific bloodshed gave rise to the political philosophy of Moral Progressivism. Dominated by the victorious powers of Firanja, Jinshan, and the Japanese Republic, the Human homeworld thrived under a syncretic vision of Islam, Buddhism, democracy, and environmentalism. As Humanity expanded into space, an enlightened and unified global government emerged to ensure lasting peace and prosperity: the Sacred Commonwealth of Earth."

A massive fungal bloom erupted across the world, psionically-sensitive parasites bursting forth from the ground itself to attack colonial infrastructure from the land, air, and sea. Their victims were driven mad by psychic visions, and the military was nearly helpless to stem the tide. Only a small percentage of the population survived the initial blossoming, but these few were then overcome by the psychic power of the alien fauna made fully manifest.

In time, great statesmen crafted the Terra Carta, the founding document of an imperial federation to govern all Humanity.

The UN Charter amendment of 2061 created the UN Parliamentary Assembly and Protectorate Council, followed in subsequent years by numerous other structural changes. The old Westphalian system was at last fatally undermined by the rise of this world government backed by the military might of emerging superpowers, Brazil and India. Continued administrative integration eventually led to the asymmetric federalization of all UN member states by 2150. In this scheme, off-world colonies are administered by various types of devolved governments under the oversight of the Protectorate until they can qualify for federal incorporation. Reliable FTL travel via hyperlanes and the prospect of interstellar colonization laid the foundation for the UN to evolve yet further into the United Systems Republic, a responsible representative government advancing the interests of Humanity on the galactic stage."

Approximately 100,000 years ago, the D'chen biomass on its homeworld Ashtar crossed a critical threshold of biological computational bandwidth and manifested a collective consciousness. The more intelligent and articulate D'chen organisms sense this consciousness as a psychic wind, always drifting through their branches and leaves. At times of crisis, this wind becomes a mighty gale, and the D'chen sway and bend with the swirling thoughts of the aggregate mind. Though at times slow to react, once in motion, the Holobiont can mobilize vast material and mental resources to achieve its goals."
